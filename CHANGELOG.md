# Changelog

All notable changes to Startup Skills are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-18

### Fixed — post-merge hygiene

- Added the `## Inferred Stage` and `## Session Pointers` sections to `references/templates/state-document-template.md` (Task 2 of the foundation plan claimed to add them but the file shipped without). The architecture spec's skill-graph routing layer depends on both sections.
- Updated `orientation` to read Session Pointers as the freshest routing signal and to write one Pointer on completion (capped at 5, oldest drops).
- Cleaned 7 stale cross-references inside `references/` that still pointed at the pre-migration flat path (`references/foo.md`) — updated to the layered path (`references/composed/foo.md` or `references/templates/foo.md`). Skill files were already migrated; this catches the references-citing-references cases the migration missed.
- Removed two accidentally-committed debug lines (local maintainer paths) from `decision-journal-template.md` and `jtbd-protocols.md`.
- Removed forward-reference debt that the v0.6.0 ship inherited from v0.1 ("ships in v0.2", "until then") in `state-document-template.md`, `state-document-protocol.md`, and `bias-sentinel.md`. CONTRIBUTING.md forbids forward-reference debt; the referenced files now exist.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-18

### Architecture — knowledge graph system

- Restructured `references/` from a flat directory into four semantic layers:
  - `composed/` — 29 pedagogically rich teaching documents (all prior references moved here)
  - `templates/` — 4 fill-in-verbatim assets (state-document-template, email-templates, pitch-deck-structure, one-pager-structure)
  - `kernels/<domain>/` — atomic concept layer, populated by `knowledge-pipeline` INGEST mode as sources are processed
  - `sources/INDEX.md` — append-only provenance table for every ingested source
- Raw source transcripts gitignored under `resources/`; only kernels and the sources index are committed.

### Added — system skills

- **`knowledge-pipeline`** (`skills/_meta/`) — INGEST/COMPOSE/AUDIT driver for the kernel graph. INGEST extracts atomic claims from a source into kernel files and logs the source in `INDEX.md`. COMPOSE wires kernels into composed references via `[[wikilink]]` citations. AUDIT checks for orphan kernels, unresolved conflicts, stale source links, and skill-graph defects. Never writes without showing diffs first.
- **`orientation`** moved to `skills/_meta/` — still the entry point for founders, now also a system skill with explicit state initialization and routing logic.

### Changed — skill description format

- All 22 SKILL.md files (21 founder skills + `knowledge-pipeline`) converted from `description: |` TRIGGER/SKIP inline routing to `description: >` with `(startup-skills)` prefix and natural-language firing conditions — the format the knowledge-pipeline AUDIT mode validates.
- Rich v0.5 body content (HARD-GATE blocks, process steps, red-flag tables, bias sentinel passes) preserved intact.
- All reference paths updated from flat `references/<file>.md` to `references/composed/<file>.md` or `references/templates/<file>.md`.

### Changed — reference paths

All skill `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/...` paths updated to reflect the new directory structure. No reference content removed; all 33 references are present under their new locations.

### Removed

- `docs/specs/2026-05-12-v0.4-design-spec.md` — superseded by `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-18-knowledge-architecture-design.md`.
- `docs/plans/2026-05-13-startup-skills-v2-improvement-plan.md` — superseded by the implemented architecture.

### Spec docs

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-18-knowledge-architecture-design.md` — full knowledge architecture design (canonical reference for contributors).
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-18-knowledge-architecture-foundation.md` — implementation plan used to execute this release.

### Spec docs

- `docs/plans/2026-05-13-startup-skills-v2-improvement-plan.md` — full v2 improvement plan (~14k words) covering audit findings, methodology refresh, new skills, architectural changes, eval harness, and 14-week phased roadmap.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- `startup-skills-pmf-and-pivot` plugin (2 skills): `pmf-audit` (Sean Ellis 40% Rule + Vohra Superhuman blueprint), `pivot-decision` (Dalton opportunity cost + Klein pre-mortem + scored candidates).
- `startup-skills-artifacts` plugin (1 skill): `artifact-builder` (pitch decks, landing pages, one-pagers, investor emails, demo day scripts; refuses pre-signal pitch decks).
- Reference library additions: `pmf-scoring` (full Sean Ellis + Superhuman implementation), `pitch-deck-structure` (10–12 slide YC format), `one-pager-structure` (async one-page format).
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` updated to register both new plugins; version bumped to 0.4.0.

### Spec completion
- This release completes the coded scope of `startup-skills-spec-v0.2.md` §7 (all 16 skills) and §8 (all 23 references). The v1.0 milestone in §12 is non-code work (evaluation harness, dogfooding, walkthrough examples).
- All forward references from earlier versions now resolve.

### Behavior changes
- `pmf-audit` refuses to authorize scaling or paid acquisition below the Sean Ellis 40% threshold.
- `pivot-decision` aggressively names sunk cost when evidence supports a pivot; also refuses to validate chronic pivoting (3+ pivots in 6 months) as productive work.
- `artifact-builder` refuses pre-signal pitch decks; produces deck with thin-section warnings otherwise.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- `startup-skills-execution` plugin (4 skills): `rapid-experiments`, `mvp-architect`, `pricing-model`, `outreach-engine`.
- Reference library additions: `validation-techniques`, `landing-page-patterns`, `mvp-examples`, `pricing-frameworks`, `sales-funnel-math`, `tool-recommendations`.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` updated to register the new plugin; version bumped to 0.3.0.

### Behavior changes
- `rapid-experiments` refuses to design Fake Door tests for B2B-enterprise archetypes (trust damage).
- `mvp-architect` gates feature scoping behind a `rapid-experiments` behavioral signal — or requires explicit risk acknowledgment.
- `pricing-model` refuses B2B freemium pre-PMF and refuses to defer the pricing decision.
- `outreach-engine` refuses paid acquisition pre-PMF, sales hire pre-PMF, and press/PR-as-acquisition.

### Known limitations of v0.3
- PMF, pivot, and artifact plugins still pending — see roadmap in README. Forward-references to `pmf-scoring.md`, `pitch-deck-structure.md`, and `one-pager-structure.md` from current skills will resolve in v0.4.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- `startup-skills-validation` plugin (3 skills): `problem-focus`, `discovery-coach` (PREPARE + DEBRIEF modes), `signal-audit`.
- Reference library additions: `mom-test-principles`, `evidence-weighting-matrix`, `false-signal-detection`, `email-templates`.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` updated to register the new plugin; version bumped to 0.2.0.

### Resolved
- v0.1 forward-references to `evidence-weighting-matrix.md`, `mom-test-principles.md`, and `false-signal-detection.md` now resolve to actual files. SKILL.md files in `startup-skills-core` and `startup-skills-discovery` that cited these references (notably via `bias-sentinel.md` and `state-document-template.md`) now have full backing.

### Known limitations of v0.2
- Execution, PMF, pivot, and artifact plugins still pending — see roadmap in README. Skills that forward-reference `pmf-scoring.md`, `validation-techniques.md`, `landing-page-patterns.md`, `mvp-examples.md`, `pricing-frameworks.md`, `sales-funnel-math.md`, `tool-recommendations.md`, `pitch-deck-structure.md`, and `one-pager-structure.md` will resolve when v0.3 and v0.4 ship.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- Initial release.
- `startup-skills-core` plugin (2 skills): `orientation`, `founder-context`.
- `startup-skills-discovery` plugin (4 skills): `idea-genesis`, `market-intel`, `idea-pressure-test`, `cofounder-fit`.
- Reference library v1 (10 documents): `tone-and-stance`, `state-document-template`, `state-document-protocol`, `bias-sentinel`, `research-playbook`, `scoring-rubrics`, `tar-pit-detection`, `cofounder-frameworks`, `case-studies`, `external-resources`.
- Marketplace manifest (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) and per-plugin manifests.
- `README.md` covering install paths, the thesis, the six personas, methodology, and roadmap.
- `LICENSE` (PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0).

### Known limitations of v0.1
- Validation, execution, PMF, pivot, and artifact plugins not yet shipped — see roadmap in README.
- Several v0.1 skills forward-reference references that arrive in v0.2 (`mom-test-principles`, `evidence-weighting-matrix`, `false-signal-detection`). Forward references are intentional and documented; the cited skills (`discovery-coach`, `signal-audit`, etc.) ship in v0.2.
