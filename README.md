# Startup Skills

A Claude Code plugin that turns Claude into a thinking partner for founders. Idea to PMF, with Y Combinator methodology, the Mom Test, the Lean Startup, and behavioral economics applied as structural checks on weak evidence.

**Status:** v0.4 — full coded scope complete. 16 skills, 23 references.

---

## What Is This?

Startup Skills compresses the time between "I have an idea (or no idea)" and "I know whether this is real." It keeps compressing it through customer discovery, MVP design, first customers, and product-market fit measurement. The system is distributed as a GitHub repository structured as a Claude Code plugin; users install with two commands and get a thinking partner who actively scours Reddit, G2, Crunchbase, and job postings while they're talking.

The tone is direct and grounded in evidence. The system will tell a founder their idea fits a tar pit pattern, won't weight polite-customer signal as real data, and pushes back hard when a founder wants to build before behavioral demand is validated — and it always pairs the pushback with the next concrete move, because pushback without a path forward is just discouragement. It's firm because hedging on weak evidence usually costs founders months, and most early-stage failures come from cognitive bias under pressure, not bad execution. Awareness of bias does not cure bias. The system installs the structural checks — evidence weighting, pre-mortems, falsification pre-commitments — that bias-awareness alone cannot.

16 skills total, plus a shared reference library of canonical methodology. Each skill is small, opinionated, and oriented toward a specific failure mode that destroys early-stage startups.

## The Thesis

> The most expensive mistake in startups is building something nobody wants. The second most expensive is discovering this after six months instead of six days. Startup Skills compresses that distance — combining the founder's domain intuition and judgment with Claude's ability to research at scale, identify cognitive bias in real time, build validation artifacts in minutes, and pattern-match across thousands of startup stories. The human does what only humans can: have lived expertise, build relationships, make sales calls, commit. Claude does what only Claude can: read the entire internet, never tire of pushing back, structurally enforce evidence over opinion. The system is not a coach in the soft sense. It is a thinking partner whose job is to keep the founder honest about what the evidence actually says — long enough to find out what's true.

## Who Is This For?

Six personas, all served by the same system; only the entry point differs.

- **The first-time founder with no idea.** Has motivation, no clear domain. Enters via `idea-genesis`.
- **The domain expert with an idea.** Industry professional who has observed pain. Enters via `idea-pressure-test`.
- **The technical builder with capacity but no problem.** Engineer or PM who can build but has no validated pain to solve. Enters via `market-intel` → `idea-genesis`.
- **The stuck founder.** 3–6 months in, no traction. Enters via `signal-audit` → `pivot-decision`.
- **The side-project builder.** Working a day job, limited time. Uses `rapid-experiments` for fast validation.
- **The post-launch founder seeking PMF.** Has users, wants to know if they have product-market fit. Enters via `pmf-audit`.

Built for U.S.-style technology startups (the YC archetype: tech-enabled, venture-fundable, scaling through software). Less applicable to traditional small businesses, services-only firms, and businesses for which Sean Ellis-style PMF is not a meaningful metric.

## What Is Included?

### The 16 Skills

- **`orientation`** — Entry point. Initializes `STARTUP-STATE.md`, explains the system, routes to the next skill.
- **`founder-context`** — Captures domain expertise, technical ability, time horizon, archetype, resources, risk tolerance. Runs parallel domain research while interviewing.
- **`idea-genesis`** — For founders with no idea. Organic interview track + parallel research track. Surfaces 5–7 candidate idea spaces. Refuses SISP framings.
- **`market-intel`** — Independent web research structured as a brief (pain expressed, customer vocabulary, who's building, what's missing, why-now, tar-pit check). Refuses TAM-as-validation.
- **`idea-pressure-test`** — Steel-mans the idea first, then scores it on Dalton's 4-criteria rubric and the YC 10-question framework. Detects tar pits, schlep blindness, SISP framings. Willing to say "kill it."
- **`cofounder-fit`** — Diagnoses team gaps. Applies YC's non-negotiable rules. Produces a 4-week trial protocol on request. Refuses pre-PMF sales hires.
- **`problem-focus`** — Recursive specificity drill: turns "companies need better X" into a sharp, testable ICP hypothesis. Refuses to proceed if the ICP can't be found online.
- **`discovery-coach`** — The most important skill. PREPARE mode (Mom-Test-aligned scripts, role-play) and DEBRIEF mode (classifies every customer statement, applies 7 false-signal patterns, refines hypothesis).
- **`signal-audit`** — The PMF running score. Refuses to bless build/scale/hire/raise decisions unsupported by behavioral evidence.
- **`rapid-experiments`** — Designs Fake Door / Wizard of Oz / Concierge MVP tests matched to archetype. Enforces falsification pre-commitments.
- **`mvp-architect`** — Ruthless feature-cutting. Hard 2–6 week deadline. Refuses to scope a build until behavioral signal exists.
- **`pricing-model`** — Charge from day one. Refuses B2B freemium pre-PMF. Commits a single price into the state document.
- **`outreach-engine`** — Prospect lists, YC-style cold emails, funnel math, Continuous Launch. Refuses paid acquisition pre-PMF.
- **`pmf-audit`** — Full Sean Ellis 40% Rule + Vohra Superhuman blueprint. Freezes scaling below 40%.
- **`pivot-decision`** — Dalton's opportunity cost + Klein pre-mortem. Aggressively counters sunk cost. Generates 3–5 scored pivot candidates rooted in what the founder already learned.
- **`artifact-builder`** — Pitch decks, landing pages, one-pagers, investor emails, demo day scripts. Pulled from the state document. Refuses pre-signal pitch decks.

### Reference Library (23 documents)

`tone-and-stance`, `state-document-template`, `state-document-protocol`, `bias-sentinel`, `research-playbook`, `mom-test-principles`, `evidence-weighting-matrix`, `false-signal-detection`, `scoring-rubrics`, `tar-pit-detection`, `pmf-scoring`, `sales-funnel-math`, `validation-techniques`, `landing-page-patterns`, `mvp-examples`, `case-studies`, `email-templates`, `pricing-frameworks`, `cofounder-frameworks`, `tool-recommendations`, `external-resources`, `pitch-deck-structure`, `one-pager-structure`.

#### Reference Path

It's worth noting that the reference path in the SKILL.md files is tailored for use with Claude Code, not Claude.ai. They all use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/...` as the path. Claude.ai does not support plugin file paths. However, it will likely be able to recognize an alternative as long as you supply the references in the knowledge base. 

## Install

Two commands. That's it.

```text
/plugin marketplace add quinnhall07/startup-skills
/plugin install startup-skills@startup-skills
```

Then start a Claude Code session in your project directory and type:

```text
/skill orientation
```

Or just describe what you want — "I have an idea, can we pressure-test it?" — and the system handles routing.

The state document lives at `.claude/startup-state.md` in your project directory. It persists across sessions so you never have to re-introduce yourself. To override the path: set `STARTUP_STATE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/file.md`.

### Installing on Claude.ai (alternative, not preferred)

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Create a new Claude.ai Project.
3. Upload the `references/` folder and the `SKILL.md` files to the project's knowledge.
4. In the project's custom instructions, paste the contents of `references/state-document-protocol.md` and a one-paragraph orientation pointing Claude to the SKILL.md files.
5. Start a conversation. Claude will surface skills based on the descriptions in the SKILL.md frontmatter.
