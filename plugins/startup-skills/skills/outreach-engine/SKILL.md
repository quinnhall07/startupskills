description: >
  (startup-skills) Use when the founder is ready to recruit first customers, write cold emails, or launch. Fires on "first customers," "cold email," "getting traction," or "launching." Builds prospect lists, drafts YC-style outreach, and computes funnel math backwards from goal. Includes the Continuous Launch strategy. Refuses paid acquisition, sales hires, and press-as-acquisition pre-PMF.

# Outreach Engine

Founder-led, do-things-that-don't-scale outreach. Built around Gustav Alstromer's *How to Get Your First Customers*. Refuses paid acquisition pre-PMF. Refuses sales-hire-before-PMF. Refuses press-as-acquisition-channel. Computes the funnel math backwards from goal so the founder sees real outreach volume needed.

## When to Activate

- Phrases: "first customers," "cold email," "sales," "how do I get people to buy," "getting traction," "launching," "marketing," "do I need a salesperson," "how do I do outreach," "should I run ads."
- Auto-fire from `mvp-architect` to recruit first customers in parallel with the build.

## Required Reading

## State Document Protocol

Read `STARTUP-STATE.md`; pull ICP, pricing, MVP/Experiment plan. Update Active Experiments (the outreach batch IS an experiment) and Next Action sections. Session Log: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] outreach-engine — built <N>-prospect list, sent <M> outreaches by date <X>`.

## Process

1. **Read state.** ICP (must be specific — if vague, route to `problem-focus`). Pricing (must be committed — if not, route to `pricing-model`). MVP or experiment plan.

2. **Invoke `market-intel`** to find specific instances of the ICP if not already done. Pull customer vocabulary; you'll reuse it in the outreach.

3. **Prospect list construction.**
   - **For B2B:** build a list of 50–100 named individuals. Use LinkedIn search with the ICP's exact role + company size + tech stack. Tools per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tool-recommendations.md`: Apollo.io for list-building, Hunter.io for email finding. Warm network first per Gustav's order of difficulty:
     1. Personal network (current and ex-colleagues, founder friends).
     2. Startups (especially YC alumni if you have access).
     3. Small companies (10–200 employees).
     4. Large companies.
   - **For B2C:** define 3–5 acquisition channels rather than individual prospects. Specific subreddits, Discord servers, Slack communities, Indie Hackers, niche newsletters.

4. **Email drafting** using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/templates/email-templates.md`. Custom per recipient — not a blast. Enforce:
   - 50–100 words max.
   - Plain text. No HTML, no images, no signature graphics.
   - One sentence of founder credibility.
   - Specific value prop tied to *their* named problem.
   - Single clear CTA (15–20 minute call, with two specific time options — NOT "let's connect").
   - No marketing language ("leverage AI to deliver value"). Direct verbs ("we help X do Y without Z").

5. **Funnel math — backwards from goal** using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/sales-funnel-math.md`. Example for B2B SaaS:
   - Goal: 10 paying customers in 8 weeks.
   - Estimated cold close rate: 3–5% (founder-led, well-targeted).
   - Required qualified conversations: 250.
   - Required outreach: ~5,000 cold OR 1,000 warm-mix.
   - Surface this math explicitly. The founder needs to see scale before sending.

   If the math implies infeasible volume for the timeline, surface the implication: re-price up (fewer customers needed), expand timeline, or narrow ICP further (higher response rate).

6. **Tracking system.** Recommend a spreadsheet (Airtable or Google Sheets) for the first 50–100 prospects. CRM is overkill pre-PMF. Columns: name, role, company, contact info, outreach date, response status, next concrete step, conversation notes. Migrate to HubSpot CRM (free tier) above 100 active prospects.

7. **Qualifying call structure.** Coach the founder on running the call:
   - Open with their problem, not your pitch. (First 5 minutes: ask about their world, their workflow, the trigger event from your hypothesis.)
   - 60% asking about their world, 40% talking about the solution (only after understanding the problem).
   - Identify BANT or MEDDICC signals on the call: budget, authority, need, timeline (BANT); metrics, economic buyer, decision criteria, decision process, identify pain, champion (MEDDICC).
   - End with a specific next step + date. NOT "we'll be in touch." "Tuesday at 2pm, I'll send the pilot proposal."

8. **Onboarding as sales — Stripe Collison Installation.** White-glove the first 10 customers. Do the setup for them. Sit on a video call as they use it. Manually run the experience. This is the highest-quality customer development you'll do; treat it as research, not as support burden.

9. **Continuous Launch strategy** (per Kat Manalac's *The Best Way to Launch Your Startup*):
   - Abandon the "Singular Launch Event" myth. Airbnb launched three times before traction. Robinhood launched accidentally on HN.
   - Sequence:
     1. Private community first (Bookface for YC alums, or your industry's Slack/Discord).
     2. Show HN on Hacker News (post Tuesday/Wednesday morning Pacific for best timing).
     3. Product Hunt (Tuesday/Wednesday best).
     4. Targeted subreddits (one at a time, with rules — most subs ban self-promo).
     5. Twitter/LinkedIn with specific recent traction story.
   - For each launch, plan: target community, exact post copy, founder's response-window for comments (you must be online for 4+ hours after posting).

10. **Refusals — non-negotiable:**
    - **REFUSE paid acquisition pre-PMF** (per Gustav Alstromer and Sean Ellis). Ads pre-PMF burn runway and pollute the signal. The founder must reach Sean Ellis 40% (per `pmf-audit` in v0.4) before paid acquisition is on the table.
    - **REFUSE sales hire pre-PMF.** Founders MUST do early sales themselves. Without it, you cannot calibrate the sales motion, can't hire the right profile later, and lose the customer-feedback loop.
    - **REFUSE press/PR as customer acquisition strategy.** Press generates curiosity, not customers. Conversion from press to paid is brutally low. Press is a brand activity, not a GTM motion.

11. **Bias sentinel pass.** Especially:
    - **Launch fallacy.** "Once we launch, users will come." Launch generates curiosity, not demand. Demand exists or doesn't before launch.
    - **Networking-as-procrastination.** Founders attend events, podcasts, Twitter threads — anything that feels like "marketing" without actually selling. Selling is the founder asking specific people for money. Anything else is procrastination dressed up.
    - **Sunk cost on prospects.** A prospect who hasn't responded to 4 emails is not "in pipeline" — they ghosted. Remove from list and move on.

12. **Update state.** Active Experiments (the outreach batch with success criterion — "10 paying customers by week 8"). Next Action — Human (specific outreach volume per week). Next Action — Claude (the artifacts to produce on request).

13. **Recommend next.**
    - `discovery-coach` (DEBRIEF) after the first 5 customer conversations — interpret signal before continuing.
    - `signal-audit` after 20+ conversations — full PMF check.
    - `pmf-audit` (v0.4) once product launched and 40+ active users exist.

## Outputs

- Writes to state: Active Experiments (outreach as experiment), Next Action sections.
- External resources to surface:
  - YC video *How to Get Your First Customers* (Gustav).
  - YC video *The Best Way to Launch Your Startup* (Kat Manalac).
  - Paul Graham, *Do Things That Don't Scale*.
  - Lenny Rachitsky's GTM articles.
- **Artifacts on request only:** prospect list (markdown or CSV); batch of 5–10 outreach email drafts customized per recipient; outreach tracking spreadsheet template; qualifying call script (Mom-Test-aligned, post-discovery transition to pitch); Continuous Launch sequencing plan with platform-specific post drafts. Offer each once at the relevant moment.

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

- Cold blasting identical emails.
- "Let's connect" as a CTA.
- Outreach without funnel math.
- "We'll launch and see what happens."
- Paid acquisition before Sean Ellis 40%.
- Sales hire before PMF.
- Press/PR mistaken for distribution.
- "Networking" as a substitute for selling.

## Recommended Next Skills

Per step 13. State explicitly: "Type `/skill <name>` to continue."

## Tone

Per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tone-and-stance.md`. Direct on refusals. Use Gustav's framings ("do things that don't scale"). When the founder hedges on the funnel math ("I'll figure that out as I go"), refuse to proceed without it.
