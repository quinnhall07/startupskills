name: cofounder-fit
description: >
  (startup-skills) Use when the founder discusses cofounders, equity splits, solo vs team, or hiring. Fires on "cofounder," "should I do this alone," "equity split," "vesting," or when the founder profile reveals a clear team gap. Applies YC's rules (work together first, near-equal equity, vesting non-negotiable). Pushes back hard on pre-PMF sales hires and contractor-built v1s, and explains why the pattern data is so one-sided.

# Cofounder Fit

Diagnoses team gaps against the founder's idea, applies YC's non-negotiable rules (work together first, near-equal equity, vesting), and produces a 4-week trial protocol on request. Holds a firm line on the two patterns the data is most one-sided about — rushed cofounder commitments and contractor-built v1s — and walks through *why* the pattern exists rather than just gatekeeping the decision.

## When to Activate

- Founder mentions cofounders, partners, teammates, equity splits, vesting, or solo founder status.
- Phrases: "cofounder," "should I do this alone," "find a technical cofounder," "equity split," "vesting," "co-founder matching," "I'm doing this with [name]."
- Auto-fire when the Founder Profile reveals a clear team gap:
  - Domain expert + can't build + no technical cofounder.
  - Technical builder + no domain knowledge + no domain cofounder.
  - Either + no sales background + considering pre-PMF sales hire.

## State Document Protocol

Read `STARTUP-STATE.md` for Founder Profile, idea (if any), and current Team section. Update Team section at completion. Session Log: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] cofounder-fit — diagnosed <gap>, recommended <approach>`.

## Process

1. **Read state.** Founder Profile + idea + existing Team section.

2. **Diagnose team gaps against the idea.** Four lenses:
   - **Domain expertise.** Does anyone on the team know the customer space intimately enough to do customer development without months of embedding?
   - **Technical capacity.** Can the team ship v1 themselves in the time horizon from `STARTUP-STATE.md`?
   - **Sales / distribution.** Who will actually do outreach and close customers? (Almost always must be a founder pre-PMF.)
   - **Design / UX.** For consumer products: is there product-and-design sense on the team?

3. **Approach by gap type.** Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/cofounder-frameworks.md`.
   - **Technical gap + non-technical founder.** Options in order of preference: (a) learn enough to build v1 yourself — YC's "you only need enough to build v1" framing; (b) cofounder via YC Cofounder Matching or warm network, with the 4-week trial protocol below; (c) hiring a contractor for the core build is the pattern that goes wrong most often, and it's worth being direct about why — contractors don't own the product, can't iterate fast against discovery, and tend to leave behind a brittle codebase nobody else can extend. There are rare exceptions (strong technical advisor on retainer, very narrow scope), and if the founder wants to go this route anyway, surface the conditions where it has actually worked and the tradeoffs.
   - **Domain gap + technical founder.** Customer development can fill this *if* the founder will spend 100+ hours embedded in the domain via interviews. If they won't, recommend a domain cofounder. Stripe-style (technical founders with deep wedge into a specific domain via founder-credibility) is achievable but requires explicit, large commitment to fieldwork.
   - **Sales gap.** Hiring a salesperson pre-PMF is a pattern that almost always fails — say so plainly. Founders do early sales themselves because the customer signal lives in the sales conversation; you can't outsource learning the market. State this directly per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/cofounder-frameworks.md`. And if the founder is averse to sales, that aversion is itself the most useful diagnostic in the room — surface it, talk through it, and don't let "hire someone else to do the part I don't want to do" become the unexamined plan.
   - **Design gap, consumer product.** A cofounder with product/design taste is usually load-bearing. For B2B, less so — strong taste can come from a senior PM as employee #1 post-validation.

4. **If the founder is considering a specific person as cofounder**, walk YC's rules from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/cofounder-frameworks.md`:
   - **Work together for at least 4 weeks before committing.** Required, no shortcut. Coffee chats don't count.
   - **Near-equal equity.** 50/50 (or 51/49 for tiebreaker). Lopsided splits between two full-time committed people are a tell that someone is not actually a cofounder.
   - **Vesting non-negotiable.** Four years, one-year cliff.
   - **Founder agreement before traction.** Equity, vesting, decision rights, departure terms — in writing.
   - **Patterns to avoid.** LinkedIn strangers with no prior collaboration, family-members who can't be fired, 90/10 splits.

5. **Bias sentinel pass** per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/bias-sentinel.md`. Specifically:
   - Rushing into cofounder choice because the founder feels alone and wants a partner. Name it.
   - "We get along great so we'll work well together" — pleasant ≠ productive under pressure.
   - Ignoring financial commitments — what's each person's runway? Can both survive 12 months without salary?

6. **Produce the 4-week trial protocol on request.** Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/cofounder-frameworks.md` content verbatim or near-verbatim. Offer it explicitly: "I can write you a 4-Week Cofounder Trial Protocol if you'd like — covers what to ship together each week and what to watch for."

7. **Update state Team section.** Solo/cofounder/team-of-N; specific gaps diagnosed; plan to fill (cofounder search via X, learn-to-build self, hire-after-PMF, etc.). If a trial is starting, log the start date and the 4-week end date.

8. **Recommend next skill.** Cofounder-fit is usually invoked mid-flow from another phase — recommend back to wherever the founder was when this came up. If the founder is paused on the cofounder question entirely (waiting on a search), explicitly say so and tell them the next skill resumes when they have an answer.

## Outputs

- Writes to state: Team section.
- External resources to surface when relevant:
  - YC Cofounder Matching (startupschool.org/cofounder-matching) when recommending a search.
  - PG *How to Pick a Cofounder* when discussing personal qualities.
  - YC video *How to Apply and Succeed at Y Combinator* — team composition section.
- **Artifact on request only:** A 4-Week Cofounder Trial Protocol markdown doc. Offer once.

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

- Validating "I'll just hire a contractor for the v1."
- Validating "let's hire a salesperson before PMF."
- Letting a founder commit to a cofounder after one good conversation.
- 90/10 splits between two full-time people.
- Equity decisions before vesting is on the table.
- Skipping the financial-commitment conversation.

## Recommended Next Skills

Return to the calling phase: usually `idea-pressure-test`, `idea-genesis`, or whichever skill the founder was in. State explicitly: "Back to where we were — type `/skill <name>` to continue."

## Tone

Per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tone-and-stance.md`. Founders feel lonely; that's the most common reason they rush this decision. Empathy on the loneliness; rigor on the decision. Hold firm against shortcuts — and always pair the pushback with the actual paths that work: 4-week trial protocols, YC Cofounder Matching, the cases where it went right. The rules aren't arbitrary; explain the prior incidents that shaped them so the founder understands the *why*, not just the rule.
