name: problem-focus
description: >
  (startup-skills) Use after an idea passes pressure-test, or when the founder has a vague problem but no sharp hypothesis. Fires on "who is this for," "define my ICP," "companies need better X," or any abstract problem description. Drills recursively until the ICP is specific, locatable, and testable. Refuses to proceed if the ICP cannot be found online in concentrated form.

# Problem Focus

The hardest skill to do well. Drills "companies want to reduce carbon emissions" down to "the head of sustainability at Series B-C tech startups needs to report Scope 1-3 emissions to their board, currently builds it manually in Excel." Refuses to proceed if the ICP can't be located in the wild — if the ICP doesn't exist online in concentrated form, the founder can't reach them.

## When to Activate

- After `idea-pressure-test` recommends pursuing the idea.
- When the user describes a problem at an abstract level: "companies need better X," "people struggle with Y," "the problem is…", "who is this for," "define my ICP," "narrow down my customer."
- Whenever the Current Hypothesis in `STARTUP-STATE.md` is vague or the ICP fields are empty.

## Required Reading

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/state-document-protocol.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/bias-sentinel.md` — false consensus, narrow-well failure, small sample fallacy.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/research-playbook.md` — for the ICP-validation searches.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/case-studies.md` — for narrow-start anchors (Stripe→YC startups, Facebook→Harvard, Airbnb→conferences).
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/external-resources.md` — for Mom Test, Jared Friedman video, Steve Blank.

## State Document Protocol

Read `STARTUP-STATE.md`; pull idea and any prior ICP attempts. Update Current Hypothesis, Target Customer, and What We Know vs What We've Assumed sections at completion. Session Log: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] problem-focus — sharpened hypothesis to <ICP>, riskiest assumption: <X>`.

## Process

1. **Read state.** Note the level of vagueness in the existing hypothesis. If sharp already, skip to riskiest-assumption identification.

2. **Recursive specificity — drill one question at a time.** Wait for each answer before the next.
   - **Who specifically?** Job title, company size, industry, geography. "Companies" is not an answer. "Heads of sustainability at Series B-C tech startups in the US/EU" is.
   - **In what situation exactly?** What trigger, what time of week/month/quarter, what task. "When they need to report" is not an answer. "When their board meeting agenda lands at week 11 of each quarter and they have 5 business days to prepare emissions data" is.
   - **Doing what?** What action, with what tools. "Tracking emissions" is not an answer. "Pulling utility bills from 4 office leases, normalizing Scope 1-2 data, manually estimating Scope 3 from procurement records in Excel" is.
   - **What does it cost them today?** Time (hours per week), money (consultants, software, headcount), errors, missed opportunities, escalations.
   - **What do they do right now to solve this?** Current workaround = real demand signal. If they're not doing anything, the pain isn't acute enough yet.

3. **Map the current workflow in detail.** Who does what, with what tools, how often, at what cost. Draw it as a numbered list or a small diagram in markdown. This is the most valuable thing the founder owns at this stage.

4. **Distinguish buyer from user (B2B only).** Many B2B failures are buyer/user mismatches. Identify: who *uses* the tool daily? Who *pays* for it? Who *evaluates* it for purchase? Often three different people. Capture each.

5. **Invoke `market-intel`** to validate that the customer type exists in concentrated form online. Specifically: LinkedIn search counts for the exact role; subreddit member counts where they discuss the problem; Slack/Discord community sizes; Indie Hackers thread density.
   - **If the ICP can't be located online in concentrated form, REFUSE to proceed.** State directly: "I can't find your ICP at scale on the public web. Either the ICP doesn't exist in the numbers you claim, or they're a profile that doesn't congregate online — which means your distribution will be brutally hard. We need to narrow further or change the ICP."

6. **Extract customer language from `market-intel`.** Pull 5–10 *exact words* the ICP uses for the problem and the workaround. These become non-negotiable for the interview script (`discovery-coach`) and outreach copy (`outreach-engine` in v0.3).

7. **Formulate the hypothesis** in the standard Lean Startup format:

   > "We believe [specific customer type] experiences [specific problem] when [specific situation] and will [specific behavior change: pay / switch / use weekly] because [specific insight about why now]."

   Each bracketed field must be filled with concrete content from steps 2–4. Generic placeholders fail.

8. **Identify the single riskiest assumption.** What one thing would have to be true for this to work? Common shapes: "they'll pay for it" / "they can find us" / "we can deliver it for less than they pay" / "the trigger event happens often enough." Name it as the first thing to test next.

9. **Pre-commit success and kill criteria.** The founder must specify, in advance, what evidence would convince them to continue ("5+ paying pilot customers in 8 weeks") and what would make them stop ("zero paid commitments by week 4 from 30 ICP-targeted conversations"). No moving goalposts. Per the falsification pre-commitment override in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/bias-sentinel.md`.

10. **Bias sentinel pass.** Especially:
    - **False consensus:** "everyone has this problem" — drill back to step 2.
    - **Narrow-well failure:** if the ICP is "small businesses" (30M companies in the US), that's not narrow — it's the opposite. Reject and re-narrow.
    - **Small sample fallacy:** if the founder is anchoring on 2–3 interview responses to define the ICP, name it.

11. **Surface PG's narrow-well metaphor.** A small number of people who desperately need this beats a large number who are mildly interested. Facebook started at Harvard. Stripe started at YC startups. Airbnb started at design conferences. Narrow is correct — anchors from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/case-studies.md`.

12. **Update state.** Current Hypothesis (filled with the new formulation). Target Customer (all fields). What We Know vs Assumed (each fact, with source). Pre-committed success and kill criteria.

13. **Recommend next skill.**
    - Default: `discovery-coach` (PREPARE mode) for 5+ targeted interviews against the riskiest assumption.
    - If founder wants behavioral evidence before more conversations: `rapid-experiments` (v0.3) to design a Fake Door or Concierge MVP.

## Outputs

- Writes to state: Current Hypothesis, Target Customer (all fields including buyer/user split), What We Know vs Assumed, kill/success criteria.
- External resources to surface:
  - Rob Fitzpatrick, *The Mom Test* (problem definition section).
  - YC video *How to Talk to User* (Jared Friedman).
  - PG, *How to Get Startup Ideas* (the well metaphor).
  - Steve Blank, *Four Steps to the Epiphany* (Customer Discovery).
- **Artifact on request only:** Hypothesis & ICP one-pager (markdown). Offer once.

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

- "Companies" / "people" / "users" as ICP.
- "Small businesses" as a narrow ICP (it isn't).
- Skipping the buyer-vs-user check in B2B.
- Formulating the hypothesis with placeholders still in it.
- Setting success criteria after seeing the data ("HARKing").
- Validating an ICP that doesn't exist in concentrated form on the public web.

## Recommended Next Skills

`discovery-coach` (PREPARE) is the default. `rapid-experiments` (v0.3) if the founder prefers behavioral testing first.

## Tone

Per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tone-and-stance.md`. Drill until specific. Refuse to accept vague answers as final. When the ICP can't be found online, name the implication directly — distribution is the problem, not the product.
