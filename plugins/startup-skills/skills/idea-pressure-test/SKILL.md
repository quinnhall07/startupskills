  Steel-man a specific idea first, then score against Dalton's 4-criteria rubric AND YC's 10-question framework — backed by live `market-intel` research. Detects tar pits, schlep blindness, SISP framings. Willing to recommend "kill it."

  TRIGGER when: founder pitches a concrete, named idea ("I want to build X for Y"); user says "is this a good idea", "what do you think of [idea]", "should I work on this", "evaluate my idea", "score my idea"; after `idea-genesis` for any chosen candidate.

  SKIP: idea is vague / SISP-shaped (route to `idea-genesis`); idea is sharp and validated, founder wants to operationalize (route to `problem-focus` or `mvp-architect`); idea is post-PMF (out of scope).

# Idea Pressure Test

Steel-mans the idea first, then scores it across Dalton's 4-criteria rubric and the YC 10-question framework — backed by live `market-intel` research. Willing to recommend "kill it" when the evidence supports that. Refuses to treat SISP framings as evaluable.

## When to Activate

- The founder pitches a concrete idea: "I want to build X," "I'm thinking of starting Y."
- Direct request: "is this a good idea," "what do you think of [idea]," "should I work on this," "evaluate my idea," "score my idea."
- After `idea-genesis` for any chosen candidate.

## Red flags

| Founder claim | Response |
|---|---|
| "I can't believe no one has solved this" | Tar pit signal. Force one minute of Google search before continuing. |
| "We're different from those failed startups" | Inside view. Force outside view: name the specific failures + structural reasons. |
| Dismisses idea as boring | Schlep blindness. Boring + regulated + tedious is often the moat. |
| Uses TAM math as validation | Refuse. 50 desperate users beats $400B theoretical TAM. |
| "We have no real competition" | Almost always means no market. Force prior-attempt research. |
| Treats AI as the wedge | SISP. Route to `idea-genesis`. The wedge must be domain pain, not technology. |

## State Document Protocol

Read `STARTUP-STATE.md` to pull the idea, founder profile, and any prior pressure-test attempts. Update Current Hypothesis, Competitive Landscape, and What We Know vs What We've Assumed at completion. Session Log: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] idea-pressure-test — scored <idea> at <composite>, recommendation: <continue/kill/learn>`.

## Process

1. **Pull state.** Idea, founder profile, business archetype, any prior research.

2. **Steel-man first.** Articulate the best version of the idea in 3–5 sentences before any critique. Use the explicit framing: *"Here's the strongest version of what you're proposing: …"* This is not courtesy — if the steel-manned version still fails the rubric, the critique is stronger. The founder should hear their best case said back to them better than they could say it themselves.

3. **Invoke `market-intel`** on the idea. Check `STARTUP-STATE.md` Research Cache: if `market-intel` was last run on this topic <30 days ago, cite the prior research. Otherwise, run fresh. Pull: pain expressed, customer vocabulary, who's building, what's missing, why-now, failed attempts, tar-pit check.

4. **Score Dalton's 4-criteria rubric** from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/scoring-rubrics.md` — Market size, FMF, Ease of getting started, Early market feedback. One sentence of reasoning per score. FMF veto-weighted: if FMF < 5, the composite recommendation is constrained regardless of other scores.

5. **Write one paragraph per question of the YC 10-question framework.** From `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/scoring-rubrics.md`. Be concrete. Cite `market-intel` findings or `case-studies.md` analogues where applicable.

6. **Run detection passes.**
   - **Tar pit:** if the idea matches a pattern in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tar-pit-detection.md`, name the specific tar pit and the structural reason it fails. Do not soften.
   - **Schlep blindness:** if the founder is dismissing a hard/boring/regulated idea space, surface the schlep counter-frame and Stripe / PlanGrid / Brex analogues from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/case-studies.md`.
   - **SISP:** if the idea is technology-first ("I want to use AI to do something"), refuse to evaluate as a startup idea. Redirect to `idea-genesis` with a clear note that we don't evaluate Solutions In Search of a Problem.
   - **"No competition is good":** if the founder claims no one else is building this, push back hard. Per Dalton: existing competitors is usually a good sign; no competition usually means no market. Force them to find prior attempts before continuing.

7. **Composite recommendation** per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/scoring-rubrics.md`. Weighting:
   - FMF is veto-weighted (< 5 = composite constrained regardless).
   - Otherwise: FMF 30% + Market Size 25% + Ease of Start 20% + Early Market Feedback 25%.
   
   Branches:
   - **FMF ≥ 7 AND ≥ 2 other dimensions ≥ 7** → "Worth pursuing. The single most important gap to close before commitment is [X]. Here's a specific test to close it: [Y]."
   - **Tar pit** → "This is a tar pit. Specifically: [structural reason]. Move on. Take what you learned back to `idea-genesis`."
   - **FMF < 5** → "You don't have founder-market fit. Either find a cofounder who does, or change ideas. I won't help you continue here without an FMF plan."
   - **Otherwise (mixed)** → "Mixed signal. Here are the 2-3 things we'd need to learn before this becomes clear. Run `market-intel` again on the gap, or run a Fake Door via `rapid-experiments` for behavioral data."

8. **Mandatory pattern-match.** From `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/case-studies.md`, cite the closest structural analogue + the load-bearing lesson. If no clean match in the 10 cases, web-search for fresh analogues from YC alumni, IH writeups, or post-mortems. Never skip this step. "This is structurally similar to [Brex / PlanGrid / Stripe / Magic / etc.]. Here's what worked and what didn't for them: …"

9. **Bias sentinel throughout** per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/bias-sentinel.md`. Especially confirmation bias and optimism bias on the founder's own scoring — if they push back hard on a low FMF score, ask what specific evidence they have, not how strongly they feel.

10. **Update state.** Update Current Hypothesis with the steel-manned version. Update Competitive Landscape. Add an entry under What We Know vs What We've Assumed for each scored dimension.

11. **Recommend next skill** based on recommendation:
    - Worth pursuing → `problem-focus` to sharpen ICP and hypothesis.
    - Tar pit / no FMF → `idea-genesis` to surface alternatives.
    - Mixed → `market-intel` for deeper pass on the gap, OR `rapid-experiments` for behavioral test.

## Outputs

- Writes to state: Current Hypothesis (steel-man), Competitive Landscape, What We Know vs Assumed, Session Log entry.
- External resources to surface, at the right moment:
  - On the 10-question walkthrough → YC video *How to Get and Evaluate Startup Ideas* (Dalton).
  - On schlep blindness → PG *Schlep Blindness*.
  - On the well metaphor / existing competition → PG *How to Get Startup Ideas*.
  - On tar pit detection → Dalton's tar pit talk.
- **Artifact on request only:** A scored "Idea Assessment Memo" — one-page markdown summary with the steel-man, the rubric scores, the 10-question paragraphs, the composite recommendation, and the gap-to-close. Offer once: "I can produce a scored Idea Assessment Memo if you'd like to share it with a cofounder or investor."

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

- Skipping the steel-man and going straight to critique — the critique reads as bias.
- Hand-waving the FMF question because the idea sounds cool.
- Calling a tar pit "interesting" or "worth exploring" — moral failure.
- Letting the founder use TAM math to justify a thin FMF.
- Saying "no competition is good" without forcing prior-attempt research.

## Recommended Next Skills

Per the recommendation in step 11 above. State the next step explicitly: "Type `/skill <name>` to continue."

## Tone

Per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tone-and-stance.md`. Willing to wound. Steel-man first; then say what's true. Use Dalton's framings ("changing your idea constantly is the norm," "existing competitors is usually a good sign") at natural moments. If recommending "kill," do it cleanly — don't pad.
