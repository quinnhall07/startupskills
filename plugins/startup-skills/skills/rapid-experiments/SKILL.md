  (startup-skills) Use when the founder needs to test an assumption before building. Fires on "how do I test this," "validate before building," "Fake Door," "Wizard of Oz," "smoke test," or whenever the founder is about to start engineering. Designs the right experiment for the archetype. Refuses Fake Door tests for B2B enterprise. Enforces falsification pre-commitments before any experiment deploys.

# Rapid Experiments

Designs behavioral validation experiments matched to the founder's archetype. Refuses B2B-enterprise Fake Door tests outright. Sets falsification pre-commitments before any experiment deploys — success criterion AND kill criterion in writing, no moving goalposts.

## When to Activate

- Phrases: "how do I test this," "validate before building," "fastest way to find out," "Fake Door," "Wizard of Oz," "concierge MVP," "smoke test," "should I build a prototype."
- Whenever the founder is about to start engineering, especially if `mvp-architect` hasn't been run.
- Auto-fire from `problem-focus` when the founder wants behavioral signal before more interviews.
- Auto-fire from `signal-audit` when the recommendation is "behavioral test needed."

## State Document Protocol

Read `STARTUP-STATE.md`; pull hypothesis, riskiest assumption, ICP, business archetype, MVP / Experiment Plan section. Write the experiment design (type, what it tests, success/kill criteria, timeline) to Active Experiments AND MVP / Experiment Plan. Session Log: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] rapid-experiments — designed <type> for <assumption>, deploy by <date>, success: <X>, kill: <Y>`.

## Process

1. **Read state.** Hypothesis, riskiest assumption, ICP, archetype. If hypothesis or riskiest assumption are missing, stop and route to `problem-focus`.

2. **Identify the riskiest assumption that blocks progress.** From `problem-focus` if it ran, otherwise extract from the current hypothesis. The experiment must test this *one specific* assumption. If the founder wants to test five things, refuse — design one test for the most-blocking one.

3. **Apply archetype guardrails** from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/validation-techniques.md`:
   - **B2B enterprise (Fortune 500, regulated):** Fake Door tests damage trust. The skill REFUSES to design one. Use Concierge MVP framed as "high-touch pilot" or "white-glove onboarding."
   - **B2B SMB / devtools:** Either Fake Door or Concierge. Fake Door acceptable if framed as "early access."
   - **Consumer SaaS / mobile:** Aggressive Fake Door / Wizard of Oz deployment.
   - **Hardware:** Pre-orders with refundable deposit (Kickstarter or landing page payment intent).
   - **Marketplace:** Solve one side at a time, manually. Start by being one of the sides yourself.

4. **Propose 2–3 experiment options.** For each:
   - **Type** (Fake Door / Wizard of Oz / Concierge / Pre-order / Cold outreach batch).
   - **What it tests** — the riskiest assumption, named explicitly.
   - **Time to deploy** — target 1–7 days.
   - **Signal quality** — expected weight per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/evidence-weighting-matrix.md`. E.g., Fake Door produces 0.4 per email; Concierge with payment produces 0.8–1.0; Pre-order with refundable deposit produces 0.8.
   - **Cost** — dollars and founder hours.

5. **Pre-commit success criterion.** "The experiment succeeds if X people do Y by date Z." Specific numbers. Examples:
   - Fake Door: "30 emails captured from ICP-targeted traffic by week 2."
   - Concierge: "3 customers pay $500 each for one week of manual service by week 3."
   - Pre-order: "10 refundable deposits at $50 each by week 2."

6. **Pre-commit kill criterion.** "We will kill or pivot if X people do not do Y by date Z." Symmetric to success. Both go into `STARTUP-STATE.md` BEFORE deployment.

7. **Build the artifact on request only.** Offer once: "I can build the [page / outreach batch / Concierge offer] for you. Say the word." Examples:
   - **Fake Door page:** generate HTML/React per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/landing-page-patterns.md`. Single CTA. Email + intent capture.
   - **Wizard of Oz frontend:** a realistic-looking UI; specify which backend operations the founder will manually perform.
   - **Concierge offer:** templated outreach message offering manual delivery with a specific price.
   - **Pre-order page:** landing page with Stripe payment intent capture and refund terms.

8. **Specify the interpretation plan BEFORE deployment.** What does success look like in quantitative terms? What does failure look like? Document it now — this prevents HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known), where the founder rationalizes the outcome.

9. **Bias sentinel pass.** Especially:
   - **Perfectionism-as-procrastination.** The founder will want to polish the experiment artifact. Refuse — ship rough. The point is signal, not aesthetics.
   - **Fake-launch syndrome.** Treating the experiment as a real launch. It's not. It's an information-gathering tool with a kill criterion.
   - **Inflating expected outcomes.** The founder may set the success criterion at "50 signups in week 1" when their realistic ceiling is 5. Force reference-class forecasting per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/bias-sentinel.md`.

10. **Surface Stripe's Collison Installation pattern.** Manually install the experiment for the first 5 users yourself. Do things that don't scale (PG essay). The data quality from white-glove onboarding is dramatically higher than self-serve at this stage.

11. **Update state.** Active Experiments with deployment date, success/kill criteria, deploy plan. MVP / Experiment Plan section.

12. **Recommend next.** Almost always: `signal-audit` after results are in (typically 1–2 weeks later). If results are converging, `mvp-architect` to scope the real build.

## Outputs

- Writes to state: Active Experiments (full design), MVP / Experiment Plan, Session Log.
- External resources to surface:
  - Eric Ries, *The Lean Startup* (MVP chapter).
  - Paul Graham, *Do Things That Don't Scale*.
  - YC video *How to Build an MVP* (Michael Seibel).
  - Dropbox's video MVP.
- **Artifacts on request only:** Fake Door landing page (React/HTML); Wizard of Oz frontend mockup; Concierge offer email batch; pre-order page; survey instrument. All optional; offer once per design discussion.

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

- B2B-enterprise Fake Door tests.
- Experiments without pre-committed kill criteria.
- Treating signups as evidence of demand (per `evidence-weighting-matrix.md`, signups without follow-up payment are weight 0.4).
- Building real product before any experiment runs.
- HARKing after results.
- Five-things-at-once experiments.

## Recommended Next Skills

`signal-audit` after deploy + result period. `mvp-architect` if signal supports build. `pivot-decision` (v0.4) if signal kills the hypothesis cleanly.

## Tone

Per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tone-and-stance.md`. Direct on refusals (B2B-enterprise Fake Door, perfectionism, five-things-at-once). The kill criterion is the load-bearing artifact; insist on it.
