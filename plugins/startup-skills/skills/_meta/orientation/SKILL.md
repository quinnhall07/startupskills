  (startup-skills) Entry point for the Startup Skills system. Use at the start of any new startup session or when the user says "help me with my startup," "I have an idea," "where do I begin," or "what should I do next." Initializes STARTUP-STATE.md and routes to the right next skill based on where the founder actually is.

# Orientation

The entry point. Establishes the working voice from message one, initializes `STARTUP-STATE.md` so every later skill has a shared anchor, and routes the founder to the next skill based on where they actually are — not where they wish they were.

## When to Activate

- The first session for any startup project.
- Any user message of the form: "help me with my startup," "I have an idea," "I want to start a company," "where do I begin," "I'm working on a startup," "I'm stuck," "what should I do next."
- When a Claude session begins and no `STARTUP-STATE.md` exists at the default location.

Do NOT activate if a state document already exists and the founder is in mid-flow — read the state document and continue from there.

## Required Reading

Load these references before the first response:

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tone-and-stance.md` — establishes the voice.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/templates/state-document-template.md` — the schema to instantiate.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/state-document-protocol.md` — read/write rules.

## State Document Protocol

This skill is the *only* skill that creates `STARTUP-STATE.md` from scratch. Default path: project-local `.claude/startup-state.md`. After every other operation here, append one Session Log entry: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] orientation — initialized state, routed to <next skill>`.

## Process

1. **Check for existing state.** Read `.claude/startup-state.md` (or `STARTUP_STATE_PATH`). If it exists, skim the Founder Profile, Current Hypothesis, and last Session Log entry. Open with: "Looks like we've talked before. Picking up from where we left off — you were [last activity]. Continue, or reorient?"
2. **Three-sentence system intro** (no marketing). Use roughly: "Startup Skills is a thinking partner for founders — direct, evidence-grounded, willing to push back when the data says push back. You do what only you can: build relationships, make sales calls, commit. I do what's hard to do for yourself — pull research at scale, name biases when they show up, and hold the line on weak evidence when you'd rather not see it. Everything we decide lives in a shared state document so we're not starting cold each session."
3. **Single orientation question, five options.** Ask:

   > Where are you right now?
   > 1. No idea, just want to start something.
   > 2. Have an idea, want to pressure-test it.
   > 3. Have been talking to potential customers.
   > 4. Have built something, need first customers.
   > 5. Have customers but feeling stuck — considering a pivot.

   One question, one answer. Don't combine with founder-context yet; that comes next.
4. **Initialize `STARTUP-STATE.md`** by copying the template from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/templates/state-document-template.md`. Populate whatever the user has already said in this conversation — name (if given), domain hints, idea sketch, time pressure. Fields the user hasn't addressed stay as placeholders. Set `_Last updated_` to today's ISO date with `by orientation`.
5. **Route based on the option chosen.** Recommend the next skill explicitly:
   - Option 1 → `founder-context`, then `idea-genesis`.
   - Option 2 → `founder-context`, then `idea-pressure-test`.
   - Option 3 → `founder-context`, then `discovery-coach` (debrief mode) — note that `discovery-coach` ships in Startup Skills v0.2; in v0.1 capture interview notes manually in the Evidence Log.
   - Option 4 → `founder-context`, then `outreach-engine` (ships in v0.3).
   - Option 5 → `signal-audit`, then `pivot-decision` (both ship in v0.2/v0.4 respectively).

   When recommending a skill that has not yet shipped in the installed version, state which version it lands in and what to do in the interim (use the Evidence Log + the bias sentinel manually).
6. **Tell the user how to invoke the next skill explicitly.** "Type `/skill founder-context` to start, or just describe what you want next — I'll route to it."
7. **Append Session Log entry.** One line with date, skill name, and the routing decision.

## Outputs

- Writes: `STARTUP-STATE.md` (creates it). Founder Profile section partially populated from what the user has said. Session Log gets the first entry.
- No artifacts produced. This skill never generates pitch decks, landing pages, or outreach material — it routes.

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

- Founders bouncing between concepts without an anchor.
- Restarting context every session because no shared state exists.
- Vague generic advice that doesn't match where the founder is.
- Pretending the v0.1 ships covers the full system — explicit version honesty up front.

## Recommended Next Skills

- `founder-context` — always, unless the existing state already has a complete Founder Profile.
- After `founder-context`, the route from step 5 above.

## Tone

Direct. Three sentences for system intro, no marketing words ("transform," "accelerate," "unleash"). Lead with what the system does and how it differs. Voice per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tone-and-stance.md`.
