# MVP Architect

Ruthless feature-cutting against a single validated hypothesis. Hard 2–6 week deadline; anything longer is not an MVP, it's a v1. Identifies the hair-on-fire early adopter who tolerates a crappy product. Refuses to scope a build until behavioral validation exists — or makes the founder explicitly accept the risk.

## HARD-GATE — do not scope an MVP unless:

- [ ] `rapid-experiments` has produced behavioral signal AT LEAST 0.6+ weight, OR
- [ ] Founder explicitly acknowledges pre-validation risk (logged below), AND
- [ ] Pricing is committed in `STARTUP-STATE.md` Pricing section, AND
- [ ] ICP is sharp (Target Customer section populated, not vague), AND
- [ ] AI build stack is chosen if AI-product (via `ai-mvp-stack-selection`)

**If pre-validation risk-accept path chosen**, log to `STARTUP-STATE.md` MVP/Experiment Plan with this exact format:

> **Pre-validation Risk Accepted [YYYY-MM-DD]**: Founder chooses to build without behavioral test. Acknowledged: timeline will slip; signal quality will be lower; iteration cost will be higher. Proceeding.

## When to Activate

- Phrases: "time to build," "let's start the MVP," "what should v1 include," "ready to write code," "I have validation, now what," "what's the minimum I need to ship."
- Auto-fire from `rapid-experiments` when results meet success criteria.
- Auto-fire from `signal-audit` when stage advances to early-signal or higher AND the founder asks about building.

## Red flags

| Founder claim | Response |
|---|---|
| "v1 needs accounts, billing, admin, analytics, mobile..." | Feature creep. Cut everything except the hypothesis test. |
| Targeting mainstream customer, not hair-on-fire | MVP premature. Force the brick test. |
| "I'll just ship it and see" without kill criterion | Refuse. Pre-commit kill criterion before scope is done. |
| Timeline >6 weeks | Cut more features OR scope back the hypothesis test. |
| Vibe-coding auth / payments / PII | Cite `ai-era-anti-patterns.md` Trap 6. Craft-code only for these surfaces. |
| Building before pricing is committed | Refuse. Pricing changes MVP shape. Route to `pricing-model` first. |
| Building before AI-stack chosen (AI-product) | Route to `ai-mvp-stack-selection`. |
| Three-month "MVP" plan | That's a v1. Re-scope to <6 weeks. |

## State Document Protocol

Read `STARTUP-STATE.md`. Pull PMF Running Score, Active Experiments, hypothesis, ICP. If `rapid-experiments` has not produced behavioral signal, gate-check (step 2 below). Write to MVP / Experiment Plan with the full scoped spec. Session Log: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] mvp-architect — scoped MVP, <N> features, <M> weeks, hair-on-fire ICP: <X>`.

## Process

1. **Read state.** PMF score, Active Experiments results, current hypothesis.

2. **Gate check — has `rapid-experiments` produced behavioral signal?**
   - **If YES (≥0.6 weight on at least one experiment):** continue.
   - **If NO:** state directly: "You haven't run a behavioral test yet. Building real product now is a bet you can guess the hypothesis right on the first try — data says you can't. Strongly recommend running a Fake Door, Concierge, or pre-order test first via `rapid-experiments`. If you want to proceed anyway, say 'I accept the pre-validation risk' and we'll log it explicitly — but I'm flagging that you're building on attitudinal evidence." Log per HARD-GATE format above.

3. **State the hypothesis the MVP tests, in one sentence.** Pull from `STARTUP-STATE.md`. If it's vague, refuse — return to `problem-focus`.

4. **List candidate features.** Ask the founder for everything they think v1 needs. Don't push back yet — collect.

5. **Cut with extreme prejudice** using YAGNI-against-hypothesis. For each feature, ask one question: *"Does the hypothesis test require this feature, or is this for some hypothetical v2 user?"* Cut every feature where the answer is "v2." Michael Seibel's framing: "Be desperate to leave features out."

6. **Reference canonical narrow MVPs** from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/mvp-examples.md`. The pattern: ridiculously narrow, ridiculously crappy. Ship it.
   - **Airbnb v1**: no payments, no maps, only conferences, air mattresses. 2 weeks to first user.
   - **Twitch v1**: one streamer (Justin Kan with head-cam), one page, no gaming-specific features.
   - **Stripe v1**: manual nightly bank faxes by Patrick + John. Only YC startups. Charged from day 1.
   - **DoorDash v1**: static webpage + founders driving food themselves. Zero software.
   - **Dropbox v1**: 3-minute video demo. Product didn't exist. 5k → 75k beta signups overnight.
   - **Buffer v1**: two-step landing page test for willingness-to-pay BEFORE writing product code.

7. **Identify the hair-on-fire early adopter** — Michael Seibel's brick metaphor: the customer whose pain is acute enough they'll use a brick if the brick solves the problem. Specific named role, specific named situation. NOT the mainstream customer. If the founder can't name a hair-on-fire ICP, the MVP is premature; return to `problem-focus`.

8. **Set the success criterion.** "MVP succeeds if X people do Y within Z weeks." Pre-committed, falsifiable. Examples:
   - "5 customers pay $200/month and use it weekly by week 8 post-launch."
   - "10 active daily users (DAU/MAU > 30%) on the hair-on-fire ICP segment by week 6."

9. **Set the kill criterion.** "MVP is killed if X people do not do Y by Z." Symmetric to success. Both go into `STARTUP-STATE.md`.

10. **Set a hard timeline — 2 to 6 weeks.** Anything longer is not an MVP; it's a v1. If the cut feature list cannot ship in 6 weeks with current resources, cut more features. If still can't, the hypothesis test is too ambitious; scope back.

11. **Reference Class Forecasting** per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/bias-sentinel.md`. Force outside-view timeline:
    - Name 3-5 comparable MVPs in the founder's archetype.
    - Pull their actual end-to-end timeline (from spec → first paying customer).
    - Use the **median** (not the optimistic case).
    - If still uncertain, multiply the founder's estimate by 3 (Lovallo/Kahneman planning fallacy correction).
    - Example: "Your estimate is 4 weeks. Three comparable B2B SaaS MVPs (Linear, Notion, Tally) took median 12 weeks to first paying customer. Using the outside view: plan for 12 weeks, hope for 8."

12. **Bias sentinel pass.** Especially:
    - **Planning fallacy.** Force outside-view timeline.
    - **"Fake Steve Jobs" syndrome.** Wanting to build a perfect product. The MVP is not a small version of v1; it's a falsification experiment.
    - **Feature creep.** As the conversation continues, the founder will want to add features back. Refuse one at a time, with the same question from step 5.

13. **Produce the MVP spec on request.** Markdown doc with:
    - **Hypothesis** (one sentence)
    - **Hair-on-fire ICP** (specific role + situation)
    - **Success criterion** (numbers + date)
    - **Kill criterion** (numbers + date)
    - **Must-have features** (the cut list)
    - **Explicitly excluded features** (so the founder doesn't quietly add them back)
    - **Timeline** (2–6 weeks max, with weekly milestones)
    - **Technical stack recommendation** (tool-agnostic with options from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tool-recommendations.md` — typically Next.js + Vercel + Supabase or Postgres + Stripe for SaaS; native + Firebase for mobile)
    - **Launch plan** (who the first 5 customers are by name, how they'll be onboarded — Stripe Collison-style)

14. **Explicit handoff.** When in Claude Code, invoke `brainstorming` (from superpowers plugin) or `writing-plans` with the MVP spec to plan the actual build. When in claude.ai, produce a clean spec the user can hand to a developer or paste into Claude Code. For AI-product builds, ensure `ai-mvp-stack-selection` has been run first.

15. **Update state.** MVP / Experiment Plan (full spec). Active Experiments (the MVP is itself an experiment with success/kill criteria).

16. **Recommend `outreach-engine`** to line up first users in parallel with building. Also: `ai-mvp-stack-selection` if AI-product and stack not yet chosen; `pricing-model` if pricing not committed.

## Outputs

- Writes to state: MVP / Experiment Plan, Active Experiments, Session Log.
- External resources to surface:
  - Michael Seibel, *How to Build an MVP* (YC video).
  - Eric Ries, *The Lean Startup*.
  - Michael Seibel, *Product Development Cycle Fundamentals* (for post-MVP iteration).
  - Airbnb founders' early-day stories.
- **Artifact on request only:** Full MVP spec document (markdown), suitable for handoff to a developer or to Claude Code's `brainstorming` skill.

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

- Building without behavioral validation (gated with explicit risk acknowledgment).
- Feature creep during scoping.
- Timeline >6 weeks without re-cutting features.
- "v1 needs accounts, billing, admin, analytics, mobile, …" — the canonical feature-creep list.
- Targeting mainstream customers with the MVP.
- Inside-view timeline estimation.
- Skipping the parallel `outreach-engine` workstream.

## Recommended Next Skills

`outreach-engine` in parallel with the build (recruit hair-on-fire customers). `signal-audit` at week 4 of the MVP build to check progress against success criterion. `ai-mvp-stack-selection` if AI-product and stack not yet chosen. `pricing-model` if pricing wasn't committed before scoping (it should have been — pricing changes MVP shape).

## Tone

Per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tone-and-stance.md`. Sharp on feature cuts. Use Seibel's "desperate to leave features out" framing. Refuse the founder's natural urge to add the "obvious" v2 features back during scoping.
