  (startup-skills) Use post-launch to maintain the customer-discovery cadence and prevent PMF drift. Fires on "what features should I build next," "weekly customer cadence," or whenever more than 14 days have passed since the last logged customer interview. Builds and updates an Opportunity Solution Tree (Torres). Refuses to let the team stop interviewing after launch.

# Continuous Discovery

Discovery is not a one-time validation sprint. After PMF, the cohort changes, expectations rise, competitors ship. Founders who stop interviewing after validation drift out of PMF within 6–18 months — the PMF Treadmill (Reforge/Balfour). This skill enforces Teresa Torres's weekly cadence and maintains the Opportunity Solution Tree as the team's shared map of outcome → opportunity → solution → assumption-test.

## HARD-GATE — do not proceed past this without:

- [ ] User is post-validation (MVP shipped OR PMF stage >= early-signal). If pre-validation, route to `discovery-coach` first.
- [ ] User confirms commitment to weekly cadence (1 interview per week minimum, ongoing).
- [ ] Existing Opportunity Solution Tree in `STARTUP-STATE.md` OR willingness to build one in this session.

If any unchecked: STOP. Either route to the correct skill, or ask the founder to commit to the cadence before continuing. Refuse to do roadmap work without the gate.

## When to Activate

- Phrases: "what features should I build next," "what should be on the roadmap," "are we still doing customer interviews," "weekly customer cadence," "a customer asked for X — should we build it."
- Calendar trigger: >14 days since the last logged customer conversation in `STARTUP-STATE.md`.
- Whenever a new feature request arrives that has not been independently validated by >=20 ICP users.
- Auto-fire from `signal-audit` when retention shows decay and the team has stopped interviewing.

## Required Reading

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/state-document-protocol.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/continuous-discovery-patterns.md` — Torres OST, story-based interviewing, 5 assumption categories, the Product Trio.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/mom-test-principles.md` — interview hygiene; applies forever, not just pre-validation.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/evidence-weighting-matrix.md` — for classifying new interview data against the existing log.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/jtbd-protocols.md` — Switch interview for post-purchase analysis and churn understanding.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/retention-metrics.md` — to tie discovery findings to retention diagnostics.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/bias-sentinel.md` — independence-check failure, pedestal bias, recency bias.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tone-and-stance.md`

## State Document Protocol

Read `STARTUP-STATE.md` at activation. This skill maintains TWO sections: the Opportunity Solution Tree (new in schema v2) and the Evidence Log (appends new interviews; append-only). Session Log entry: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] continuous-discovery — interview #N, surfaced <X> opportunities, assumption tests queued: <Y>`.

## Process

1. **Read state.** Pull existing OST (if any), current Sean Ellis score, retention metrics, recent Session Log. Verify the state file has a post-validation marker (MVP shipped or Sean Ellis >= 40%). If not, stop and route to `discovery-coach`.

2. **Cadence check.** Scan the Session Log for the last `discovery-coach` (DEBRIEF) or `continuous-discovery` entry. If >14 days ago, surface directly: "It's been N days since your last logged customer interview. Cadence is the load-bearing discipline of this skill. Schedule one this week before continuing." Do not bypass.

3. **Define / read the outcome.** Single top-of-tree outcome, measurable. Example: "increase D28 retention from 18% to 25%." If no outcome exists in the OST section, force the founder to commit one before proceeding. No outcome = no tree = no skill.

4. **Story-based interviewing prep (PREPARE mode).** Use Torres's question shape: "Tell me about the last time you [behavior]." Scope each question by opportunity. Generate 6–10 questions, NEVER hypothetical, NEVER pitching. Apply the same anti-patterns as `discovery-coach` PREPARE.

5. **Interview debrief (DEBRIEF mode).** Run the evidence-weighting protocol from `discovery-coach` DEBRIEF, AND additionally:
   - Map each surfaced pain/need to an **opportunity** on the OST.
   - Mark whether the opportunity is new (add to tree) or recurring (increment count).
   - Apply the independence check: have >=20 ICP users mentioned this independently, or just this one? One customer's request is a clue, not a mandate.

6. **OST maintenance.** Update the tree:
   - New opportunities: add as children of the outcome (in **customer language**, never solutions).
   - New solutions: add as grandchildren of opportunities. Multiple solutions per opportunity is healthy.
   - New assumption tests: add as leaves under solutions.
   - Surface the highest-priority opportunity to test next (most-cited + tied to outcome).

7. **Assumption mapping.** For the top solution under the top opportunity, run Torres's 5-category check (desirability, viability, feasibility, usability, ethical — per `continuous-discovery-patterns.md`). Identify the riskiest assumption. Route to `rapid-experiments` for the cheapest test (<=1-day experiment). Do not let the team build the solution before testing the assumption.

8. **Retention link.** Pull current retention metrics from `STARTUP-STATE.md`. If retention is decaying or flat-but-low, surface the connection directly: "D28 dropped from 22% to 17%. The opportunities surfacing in your interviews are likely correlated. Prioritize tests against the opportunities most-cited by users who churned." Run a Switch interview per `jtbd-protocols.md` with churned users if none exist in the log.

9. **PMF Treadmill check** (per `retention-metrics.md` and `continuous-discovery-patterns.md`). If any opportunity is "what AI/competitor X already does," surface the treadmill question: "Is your core JTBD now achievable in ChatGPT/Claude in <30 seconds? If yes, your moat is eroding. Discovery should focus on workflow-embedding opportunities, not feature-parity ones." Name the drift before it ossifies.

10. **Bias sentinel pass** per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/bias-sentinel.md`. Especially:
    - **Independence-check failure.** Founder treats one customer's feature request as a roadmap mandate. Name it.
    - **Pedestal bias** (Annie Duke). Founder runs interviews but doesn't ship the assumption test. Talking != learning. Pin the next experiment with a date.
    - **Recency bias.** Last week's three interviews should not outweigh the prior 20. Weight by cohort, not by recency.

11. **Update state.** OST section with new nodes. Evidence Log append-only with new interview rows. Session Log with this entry. Never edit prior rows.

12. **Recommend next.**
    - If a clear assumption test is queued: `rapid-experiments`.
    - If retention is decaying and opportunities are workflow-related: `signal-audit` to check PMF drift.
    - If three or more interviews surface the same opportunity not addressable in the current product: `pivot-decision` (consider adjust, not full pivot).
    - Otherwise: schedule next interview, return next week. State the date explicitly.

## Outputs

- Writes to state: Opportunity Solution Tree section, Evidence Log appends, Session Log.
- External resources to surface:
  - Teresa Torres, *Continuous Discovery Habits* — canonical reading for the OST and the weekly cadence.
  - Reforge/Brian Balfour, *Why Product-Market Fit Isn't Enough* — the PMF Treadmill.
  - Bob Moesta, *Demand-Side Sales* — Switch interview technique for churn.
- **Artifact on request only:** Updated OST as a markdown visual (or Mermaid diagram) suitable for sharing with the Product Trio (PM + designer + engineer).

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

- Stopping discovery after launch.
- Treating one customer's request as a roadmap mandate.
- Building features without running the assumption test first.
- Ignoring retention signals when prioritizing opportunities.
- Letting the OST become a wishlist rather than an evidence-grounded tree.
- Allowing the team to delegate interviews ("the PM handles that"). The whole Product Trio attends — that is the point.
- Confusing feature-parity with competitors for opportunity discovery.

## Recommended Next Skills

Per Step 12. `rapid-experiments` for assumption tests; `signal-audit` for retention drift; `pivot-decision` for chronic opportunity gaps. State the next step explicitly: "Type `/skill <name>` to continue."

## Tone

Per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tone-and-stance.md` and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/aggressive-consultation-archetype.md`. Direct on cadence enforcement. The skill's value IS friction — refuse "we're too busy to interview this week" without naming the cost (PMF Treadmill drift, cohort opacity, roadmap-by-loudest-customer). Empathy on the workload; rigor on the discipline. Cadence is non-negotiable.
