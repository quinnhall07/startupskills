  (startup-skills) Use after new evidence arrives or before any major decision (build, hire, raise, scale). Fires on "is this working," "are we close to PMF," "should I build now," or "what's the data saying." Classifies evidence, applies 7 false-signal patterns, computes PMF stage, and pushes back hard on decisions the behavioral evidence doesn't support.

# Signal Audit

The PMF running score. Reads the entire evidence log, classifies any new evidence, applies the false-signal patterns, computes the current stage, and is direct about which major decisions the behavioral evidence does and doesn't support. This is where Startup Skills holds the firmest line on weak data — pushback here is the load-bearing function, because building/scaling/hiring on misread signal is the most expensive class of mistake founders make.

## When to Activate

- After every new evidence point: interview, sales call, signup data, survey result, usage data.
- Before any major decision: build, pivot, hire, raise capital, scale paid acquisition.
- Phrases: "is this working," "are we close to PMF," "what's the data saying," "should I build now," "should I scale," "ready to raise?", "should I hire?"

## Required Reading

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/state-document-protocol.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/bias-sentinel.md` — uncanny valley, confirmation bias, sunk cost.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/evidence-weighting-matrix.md` — classification.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/false-signal-detection.md` — the 7 patterns over the entire log.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/external-resources.md` — Sean Ellis, Rahul Vohra, Marc Andreessen.

Forward reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/pmf-scoring.md` ships in Startup Skills v0.4 with the full Sean Ellis 40% Rule implementation and Vohra blueprint. Until then, this skill notes when to escalate to `pmf-audit` (also v0.4) and provides the running-score functionality without the formal survey.

## State Document Protocol

Read entire `STARTUP-STATE.md` — evidence log is the whole working set, not just recent entries. Update PMF Running Score, What We Know vs What We've Assumed, and Current Decision Point sections. Session Log: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] signal-audit — stage <pre-signal/early/converging>, N=<X>, mean=<Y>, recommendation: <continue/freeze/escalate>`.

## Process

1. **Read evidence log + PMF score.** Note every entry, not just recent. Note the existing stage assessment if any.

2. **Classify new evidence.** For each new item presented, apply `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/evidence-weighting-matrix.md`. Append to evidence log. Same protocol as `discovery-coach` DEBRIEF — same matrix, same anti-lobbying discipline.

3. **Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/false-signal-detection.md` over the WHOLE log.** Not just new entries. False signals compound — a founder who collected three Enthusiasm-Trap inputs in a row becomes more confident, not less. Identify any of the 7 patterns and name the entries that match.

4. **Compute PMF dimensions:**
   - **Sample size adequacy.** How many *targeted* (within-ICP) conversations? Threshold: 20+. Below that, no stage above pre-signal is permitted.
   - **Behavioral evidence quality.** Mean weight across the log, focusing on ICP-targeted entries only.
   - **Commitment density.** Count of entries at 0.8+ weight. Below 3, no stage above early-signal is permitted.
   - **Workflow displacement evidence.** Count of entries describing prospects who restructured workflow (or asked to) because of the offer. Strong signal.
   - **Sean Ellis stage** (if applicable). For founders with deployed products and active users (≥2x usage in last 14 days from at least 40 users), recommend running the Sean Ellis survey. The full implementation lives in `pmf-audit` (v0.4); for now, surface the recommendation and the survey question.

5. **Map to a PMF stage:**
   - **Pre-signal:** <20 ICP conversations OR mean weight <0.3.
   - **Early signal:** 20+ conversations AND 3+ behavioral signals at 0.6+.
   - **Converging:** 5+ signals at 0.8+, repeated workflow displacement requests, multiple unprompted referrals.
   - **Sean Ellis confirmed:** 40%+ "Very Disappointed" on the survey (per `pmf-audit`).

6. **At decision gates, be specific about what the evidence does and doesn't support. This is where firmness matters most:**
   - **If pre-signal and founder asks about building, scaling, or hiring:** don't validate it. Say plainly: "The evidence is at pre-signal stage — that's not a basis for <action>. To support <action>, we'd need <specific evidence>. Fastest path there is <recommended skill>. Want to design what that test would look like?" Firm, but the founder leaves with a next move, not a closed door.
   - **If founder is at pre-signal for 3+ months:** raise the pivot question directly. Route to `pivot-decision` (v0.4) if available; otherwise surface the sunk-cost and optimism-bias frames from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/bias-sentinel.md` and ask what evidence in the last month should make them more confident — not less.
   - **If founder has deployed product and asks about scaling:** the Sean Ellis 40% bar comes before paid acquisition. Per Vohra's Superhuman blueprint, this is the place to hold the firmest line — paid spend below 40% reliably destroys runway and pollutes the signal. Acknowledge the part the founder got right (whatever it was — shipping, getting users, instrumentation), then explain why the survey comes before the spend.
   - **If founder is fundraising:** raise the bar on commitment density. Pre-Sean-Ellis fundraising on weak behavioral data is selling speculation. Name it directly, then talk about what could legitimately be raised on (small pre-seed, founder thesis) versus what couldn't (anything claiming PMF traction).

7. **Surface the gap.** "To advance from <current stage> to <next stage>, you need: <specific evidence>. Fastest path: <recommended next skill>." Be specific — "5 more 0.8+ commitment signals from ICP-targeted conversations" beats "more evidence."

8. **Hold the line when needed.** If a post-launch founder hasn't hit Sean Ellis 40%, the scaling/paid-acquisition recommendation is "not yet" — say so plainly and route back to Build-Measure-Learn. Per Vohra and Balfour, paid acquisition before PMF destroys runway and pollutes the signal you need to find PMF in the first place. This is a place to be firm, not theatrical: state the rule, cite the source, and offer the next experiment that *would* move the needle.

9. **Pre-mortem prompt at full audit** (per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/bias-sentinel.md` structural override). "Assume this fails in 6 months. What's the most likely cause? Now: what evidence would refute that cause? Do we have that evidence?"

10. **Bias sentinel pass.** Especially:
    - **Uncanny valley of PMF:** small marginal traction = neither clear pivot nor clear persevere. Name this state honestly. The temptation is to power through; the bias is the founder filling the data gaps with optimism. Force a return to behavioral testing.
    - **Confirmation bias on cherry-picked signals:** if the founder is anchoring on the 3 best entries while ignoring 17 zero-weight entries, name the cherry-pick.
    - **Sunk cost:** if the audit is being run because the founder is considering quitting, run the opportunity-cost reframe from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/bias-sentinel.md`.

11. **Update state.** PMF Running Score (all dimensions). Current Decision Point. What We Know vs Assumed for any newly resolved or newly contested facts.

12. **Recommend next skill.**
    - More interviews needed → `discovery-coach` (PREPARE).
    - Behavioral test needed → `rapid-experiments` (v0.3).
    - PMF measurement readiness → `pmf-audit` (v0.4) for the full Sean Ellis methodology.
    - Pre-signal 3+ months → `pivot-decision` (v0.4).

## Outputs

- Writes to state: PMF Running Score, evidence log additions, What We Know vs Assumed updates, Current Decision Point.
- External resources to surface at the right moment:
  - When recommending Sean Ellis survey: Vohra's First Round Review article *How Superhuman Built an Engine to Find Product/Market Fit*.
  - When the founder pushes back on the 40% rule: Sean Ellis's original posts on the threshold.
  - When the founder wants to call it PMF without behavioral signal: Marc Andreessen's *Only Thing That Matters* (the qualitative complement — servers melting, organic referrals, support overwhelmed).
- **Artifact on request only:** Full PMF Assessment Memo (markdown) — formal document suitable for sharing with cofounders, advisors, or investors. Offer once.

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

- Cherry-picking the 3 best entries to declare "early signal."
- Skipping the pre-mortem at decision gates.
- Allowing paid acquisition before Sean Ellis 40%.
- Declaring PMF based on attitudinal evidence.
- Letting the founder count Network-Halo signals as ICP signal.
- Soft language ("looks promising") when the evidence doesn't support it. Be honest — and pair the honesty with what *would* be promising.

## Recommended Next Skills

Per step 12 above. State explicitly which skill and what to do if it ships in a later Startup Skills version.

## Tone

Per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/composed/tone-and-stance.md`. Firmer at decision gates than at routine updates — this is the place pushback earns its keep. When holding a line, do it cleanly: name what the evidence shows, name what would change the picture, name the cheapest experiment that could get the founder there. Acknowledge the work the founder has done. The goal is not to wall off decisions — it's to make sure the next decision is built on signal that's real.
